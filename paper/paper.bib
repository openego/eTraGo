abstract = {To phase out fossil fuels, energy systems must shift to renewable electricity as the main source of primary energy. In this paper, we analyze how electrification can support the integration of fluctuating renewables, like wind and PV, and mitigate the need for storage and thermal backup plants. Using a cost-minimizing model for system planning, we find substantial benefits of electricity demand in heating, transport, and industry adapting to supply. In Germany, flexible demand halves the residual peak load and the residual demand and reduces excess generation by 80%. Flexible operation of electrolyzers has the most significant impact accounting for 42% of the reduction in residual peak load and 59% in residual demand. District heating networks and BEVs also provide substantial flexibility, while the contribution of space and process heating is negligible. The results are robust to restrictions on the expansion of the transmission grid.}

For the implementation of the energy system transformation, however, there are numerous options for the design of sector coupling, each of which is accompanied by different infrastructure requirements. This paper presents the extension of the REMix energy system modelling framework to include the gas sector and its application for investigating the cost-optimal design of sector coupling in Germany's energy system. Considering an integrated optimisation of all relevant technologies in their capacities and hourly use, a path to a climate-neutral system in 2050 is analysed. We show that the different options for flexible sector coupling are all needed and perform different functions. Even though flexible electrolytic production of hydrogen takes on a very dominant role in 2050, it does not displace other technologies. Hydrogen also plays a central role in the seasonal balancing of generation and demand. Thus, large-scale underground storage is part of the optimal system in addition to a hydrogen transport network. These results provide valuable guidance for the implementation of the energy system transformation in Germany.}

ABSTRACT = {The energy transition towards renewable and more distributed power production triggers the need for grid and storage expansion on all voltage levels. Today&rsquo;s power system planning focuses on certain voltage levels or spatial resolutions. In this work we present an open source software tool eGo which is able to optimize grid and storage expansion throughout all voltage levels in a developed top-down approach. Operation and investment costs are minimized by applying a multi-period linear optimal power flow considering the grid infrastructure of the extra-high and high-voltage (380 to 110 kV) level. Hence, the common differentiation of transmission and distribution grid is partly dissolved, integrating the high-voltage level into the optimization problem. Consecutively, optimized curtailment and storage units are allocated in the medium voltage grid in order to lower medium and low voltage grid expansion needs, that are consequently determined. Here, heuristic optimization methods using the non-linear power flow were developed. Applying the tool on future scenarios we derived cost-efficient grid and storage expansion for all voltage levels in Germany. Due to the integrated approach, storage expansion and curtailment can significantly lower grid expansion costs in medium and low voltage grids and at the same time serve the optimal functioning of the overall system. Nevertheless, the cost-reducing effect for the whole of Germany was marginal. Instead, the consideration of realistic, spatially differentiated time series led to substantial overall savings.},

On the one hand, sector coupling increases the demand for electrical energy and changes well-known demand patterns requiring updates to the grid infrastructure. On the other hand, the newly coupled sectors offer flexibility options to support the grid infrastructure and reduce expansion needs. This study employs a highly detailed model of the German transmission grid to analyse the impact of sector coupling comprising additional electricity demands and flexibility options on grid and storage expansion needs in the year 2035. The results demonstrate that utilising flexibility options can reduce system costs and lower CO2 emissions.

abstract = {Energy systems are becoming increasingly complex as developments such as sector coupling and decentral electricity generation increase their interconnectedness. At the same time, energy system models that are implemented to depict and predict energy systems are limited in their complexity due to computational constraints. Thus, a trade-off has to be made between high degrees of detail and model runtimes. As a first step towards efficiently managing the complexity of energy system models, we examine the relationship between the purpose of models and their complexity. Using fact sheets on 145 models, we manually cluster these models based on their purpose and underlying research questions. Further, we conduct mathematical clustering using several clustering methods to investigate the reproducibility of our results. For our study, we define the complexity of a model as the level of detail in which it represents reality. We distinguish the level of detail into the four dimensions of temporal, spatial, mathematical and modeling content complexity. The differences between the clusters found in these dimensions are verified statistically using confidence intervals. 112 out of 145 models can be allocated to one out of four major clusters possessing clearly distinguishable complexity profiles: unit commitment, electrical grids, policy assessment, and future energy systems. In each of these profiles, high complexity in one dimension or subdimension is compensated by low complexities in other dimensions. We therefore conclude that when creating a model, modelers allocate complexity in order of priority on those features and properties that are particularly important for fulfilling the model's purpose. Our results provide a necessary basis for the emerging field of complexity management in energy system modeling and are therefore of high interest for the scientific community and the interpreters of model results such as decision makers from policy and industry.}

National-scale energy systems optimisation models (ESOMs) have been limited in the past by the lack of sub-national data availability leading to aggregated treatment of spatial dynamics. This review paper first determines how a combination of supply and demand data requirements and socio-economic, environmental and political issues, can challenge the results of a low-spatial resolution model. It also demonstrates the incompleteness of single region ESOMs that do not capture sufficient spatial detail. Specifically, 36 multi-regional ESOMs from 22 countries with varying levels of spatiotemporal resolution, sectoral focus and planning horizon are systematically identified and comprehensively analysed. The review reveals that existing temporally explicit ESOMs with a single sector coverage can permit regional disaggregation up to the first-level administrative divisions within a country (such as state and province) while maintaining computationally tractable. Findings from the literature review also show when, how, and to what extent higher spatial resolution impact on the results of energy system analysis. (1) Finer spatial resolution in ESOMs offers significant added value for regions with heterogeneous renewable potential or across regions with higher variability in energy service demands. However, in homogeneous areas, aggregated single-region modelling is more efficient. (2) Spatially resolved models can significantly change the results of the scenarios with very high shares of variable renewable energies. But it is not straightforward to find a direct relationship between the level of geographic disaggregation and penetration of renewable energies. This trade-off should be explored case-by-case. (3) Total system costs can be under- or over-estimated in various levels of spatial resolutions. Disaggregation of renewable resources leads to lower costs, and disaggregation of transmission grids leads to higher costs.}

Developed over the second half of the twentieth century, they are now seeing increased relevance in the face of stringent climate policy, energy security and economic development concerns, and increasing challenges due to the changing nature of the twenty-first century energy system. In this paper, we look particularly at models relevant to national and international energy policy, grouping them into four categories: energy systems optimization models, energy systems simulation models, power systems and electricity market models, and qualitative and mixed-methods scenarios. We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities. In discussing these challenges, we present possible avenues for future research and make recommendations to ensure the continued relevance for energy systems models as important sources of information for policy-making.}

In this review, we outline these challenges and discuss how they have been tackled by the current literature, as well as pointing at directions for future research. Many of the existing reviews identify a list of challenges common to most models, but they tend to be grouped according to type or energy carrier. Here we take a new approach and structure both well-established models and solution approaches along with the main challenges that energy modelling will have to deal with in the near future. We focus on four main current challenges that energy system models face: time and space; uncertainty; multi-energy; energy behaviour and energy transition. The main findings suggest that: demand-side management applied to multi-carrier energy system models lacks; prosumers is explored only in a limited manner; general, multi-scale modelling frameworks should be established and considered both in the dimensions of time, space, technology and energy carrier; long term energy system models tend to address uncertainty scarcely; there is a lack of studies modelling uncertainties related to emerging technologies and; modelling of energy consumer behaviour is one of the major aspect of future research.}

	abstract = {In the ever complex world of the power systems, robust decision making in the context of investment planning becomes a difficult problem. In the decision making process, the costs and benefits of implementing complementary or com-peting technologies (AC versus DC or storage versus classical transmission expansion) need to be assessed. Additionally, the electrification of industrial demand and the integration of smart loads, such as heat pumps or electric vehicles, pave the way for demand flexibility provision on large scale. Considering that the majority of the demand flexibility is located in the distribution grid, there is a need for planning models and tools able to perform combined transmission and distribution grid planning. This paper introduces FlexPlan.jl, a Julia/JuMP-based open-source tool for holistic planning of transmission and distribution grids which includes a complete set of planning candidates for transmission and distribution networks and fully internalizes demand flexibility and storage usage. We use stochastic op-timisation, in order to find robust decisions with respect to different climate conditions and operating hours within given climate years. To keep the optimisation problem tractable, we introduce a novel decomposition between the transmission and distribution grid planning problems. We demonstrate that using the proposed approach a speed improvement of up to 100 times can be achieved for cases with a large number of distribution grids, with negligible increase of the objective function value and a good solution quality in terms of power flow.},

For that reason, this paper focuses on national energy system models that incorporate all energy sectors and can support governmental decision making processes. The reviewed models are evaluated in terms of their characteristics, like their underlying methodology, analytical approach, time horizon and transformation path analysis, spatial and temporal resolution, licensing and modeling language.

	abstract={The energy transition in Germany demands a comprehensive transformation of electricity grids at all levels, making them central to the achievement of climate goals and the integration of renewable energy in all energy sectors. However, grid infrastructure currently represents a critical bottleneck. In particular, the role of medium and low voltage grids is changing. Historically designed to distribute electricity from the transmission system to demands, medium and low voltage grids must now adapt to accommodate distributed generation, increased flexibility, and new demands driven by sector coupling. Flexibility options, such as demand response and energy storage, offer potential solutions, but their efficient deployment requires optimized coordination. In order to contribute to the identification of an effective coordination strategy, the open-source tool eGo has been developed. The objective is to quantify the expansion needs of the grid at all levels in Germany, considering flexibility options from the sectors electricity, heat, gas, and mobility using a top-down approach. The method is applied to a mid-term scenario depicting the year 2035.&#xD;The results show that while top-down dispatch optimization is effective for extra-high and high voltage grids, it can exacerbate expansion requirements in medium and low voltage grids. As a result, flexibility options can reduce system costs by only 1 %, taking into account the need for expansion at all grid levels. The curtailment of intermittent renewables can be significantly reduced by 71 %. Coordinated dispatch across grid operators and levels is therefore essential to fully leverage flexibility options, ensuring that the energy transition proceeds efficiently across the entire electricity grid.}
