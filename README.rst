eTraGo
======

Optimization of flexibility options for transmission grids based on PyPSA

A speciality in this context is that transmission grids are described by the
380, 220 and 110 kV in Germany. Conventionally the 110kV grid is part of the
distribution grid. The integration of the transmission and 'upper' distribution
grid is part of eTraGo.

The focus of optimization are flexibility options with a special focus on
energy storages. Grid expansion measures are not part of this tool and will be
instead part of 'eGo' https://github.com/openego/eGo

.. warning::
  From now on eTraGo depends on a sector coupled data-model. This is not published on 
  the oedb yet, the data has to be created using
  `eGon-data <https://github.com/openego/eGon-data>`_.
  Not all functions and features are compatible to the sector coupled model yet.
  
  When you want to use eTraGo for optimizations, please use the latest release 0.8.0. 


Installation
============
eTraGo is designed as a Python package therefore it is mandatory to have
`Python 3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/.>`_ installed. If you have a
working Python3 environment, use pypi to install the latest eTraGo version.
We highly recommend you to use a virtual environment. Use following pip
command in order to install eTraGo..

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip3 install eTraGo

Installation for Developers
===========================

Clone the source code from github:

.. code-block::

   $ git clone https://github.com/openego/eTraGo

You can checkout to the dev branch and create new feature branches.
For the correct work-flow, please mind the 
`Dreissen Branching Model <https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_

Use the pip -e to install eTraGo directly from the cloned repository:

.. code-block::

   $ pip3 install -e /path/to/eTraGo/ 


Using a virtual environment
===========================

Before installing eTraGo, 
you create a virtual environment (where you like it) and activate it:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ virtualenv venv --clear -p python3.7
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   $ cd venv

Inside your activated virtual environment you can 
install eTraGo with the pip command, as previously explained.
