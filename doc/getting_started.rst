Setup 
=========================


Run:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/openego/eTraGo
    ```

Create a virtualenvironment (where you like it) and activate it: 

   ```
   virtualenv -p python3 venv
   source venv/bin/activate 
   ```

With your activated environment `cd` to the cloned directory and run: 

    ```
    pip install -e eTraGo
    ```

This will install all needed packages into your environment. Now you should be ready to go.
