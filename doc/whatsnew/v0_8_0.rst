Release 0.8.0 (April 8, 2021)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
eTraGo has now a more object-oriented programming design.

Added features
--------------

* eTraGo uses PyPSA version 0.17.1 directly, the fork is not needed anymore. The updated pypsa version includes various features, e.g. running a lopf without using pyomo which is faster and needs less memory. 
* (n-1)-security factors are set as line/transformer parameters s_max_pu instead of adding the additional argument s_nom_original 
* There is now one central plotting function for all grid topology plots which also allows to combine different results (e.g. plot storage expansion and line expansion at once) 
* eTraGo is now compatible to Python3.7
* A bug in setting the line_length_factor in kmeans clustering is fixed.
